			<h2>How to Play</h2>

			<p>
				After clicking the text to begin the game, a task will be shown underneath the countdown.  Each task tells the player which element
				to style, and how.  This is done by referencing the elements <em>id</em> in the tasks description.  So for example if the task was: 
				"Give all anchor tags in the #newsDiv the color blue", the player would target the #newsDiv and then
				use the "a" selector to select the anchor tags inside the #newsDiv, thus producing "#newsDiv a".  Once the player has formed their style 
				declaration, they can type it in the blue style field in the bottom of the window.  The styles will take effect immediately, and if syntactically correct, can be seen dynamically in the browser window.  
				If the style typed into the style field satisfies the task requirement, and time hasn't run out, the player is awarded points and
				will be prompted with a new task.
			</p>
			
			<h2>How it Works</h2>

			<p>
				To achieve real time styling, Stylable makes use of the 
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable">content editable attribute</a> in an internal
				stylesheet.  By setting this attribute equal to "true" in the style tag, players are able to dynamically type new styles that update
				the Document Object Model (DOM).  Given that an internal stylesheet has the ability to overwrite defined styles in an external sheet,
				this method allows for players to easily style accordingly without any hierarchy issues.
